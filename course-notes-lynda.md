[Data Visualizations Fundamentals on Lynda](http://www.lynda.com/Design-Infographics-tutorials/Data-Visualization-Fundamentals/153776-2.html)

<b>Introduction</b>

- Getting the right people the right content at the right time
- We're natural storytellers
- We're in an age of data overload
- We can design for eye scanning
  - Turn image/face towards content to drive viewer
- 4x4 Model for Knowledge Content
- Create content on four levels
  - Water cooler - attention grabber, quick snippets, tweet, image, short video
  - The cafe - longer conversation, blog post, short article, medium length video
  - The research library - dig deeper, research, long articles
  - The lab - play with data and tools, interaction
- Get the right people to the right content by starting at the top level and drill down
- Components on four levels
  - Visualization
  - Storytelling
  - Interactivity
  - Shareability
- Know your audience and adjust presentation to them
  - Culture - language, perspective, narrative context (does the audience know the context of what you're showing)
  - Level of expertise - are your audience members experts or not as informed? 
  - Consumption context/channel - where you're publishing will change your output (more details, more stats, more fun, etc.)
  - Accessibility - data consumption through audio instead of visual, color blindness, think about contrast and font size [Color Blindness Simulator](http://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/)
  - True believers or skeptics? - are you sharing information to change minds or to reflect the "truth"
  - Action - why are you sharing the data? What action are you looking for from your audience? Design to achieve this action
  - Imagine that you are your audience and develop your data/visualization for them
- "Whenever you're doing a visualization, ask why should I not use a bar chart?" 
- Common chart types - bar chart, line chart, timeline, scatterplot, bubble chart
- How to make a good visualization? Make visualizations 
  - That are <b>Accurate</b>
  - That tell a good <b>Story</b>
  - That provide real <b>Knowledge</b> to your audience
- Visual form allows us to parse numbers more easily than numeric/text form
- We remember and learn more from visual information
- Gestalt Principles
  - Figure/Ground - used most often in logo design (FedEx logo), least used in data visualization but the bottom part of a visualization is perceived as the figure/data  and the top part is perceived as the background
  - Proximity - items next to or near each other are percieved as grouped/similar/together
  - Similarity - similar objects are different from dissimlar objects
  - Parallelism - things in parallel are assumed to be together and similar, patterns/trend lines in visualizations
  - Common Fate - items moving or moving in the same direction are percieved as together (animated visualzations)
  - Closure and Continuity - our brain completes pictures, we see things that aren't there; culture can influence continuity
  - Key to how people percieve things visually
  - Use them to draw attention and differentiate pieces of a visualization
  - Think about these priniciples to maximize brain engagement and triggers
- Understand your data
  - Mean vs. Median - need to understand the spread and make-up of your data to know which stat to use (outliers, consistency, etc.)
  - Actual Number vs. Rank Index vs. Percentile - what will be most helpful to understanding? Numbers can be too big to understand, rank and percentile can show comparisons 
  - Change in Numbers vs. Actual Number - rate of change might be more infomrative than the actual number 
  - Know sample size and methodology - how was the data collected? What's its quality and reliability?
  - Correlation vs. Causation
  - Start with a headline
  - What's the headline for the data? Figure out how to summarize it in a few words
  - Figure out headline without the "answers" filled in because you want to look to the data for the answers and remove bias
  - Be able to spot mistakes - you need to know your data well enough to spot mistakes then you can dig in and correct
  - Make sure you don't succumb to bias when looking at your data and developing visualizations - be open to the data showing something you don't expect
