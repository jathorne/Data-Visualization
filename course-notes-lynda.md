<b>Introduction to Visualization</b>

- Getting the right people the right content at the right time
- We're natural storytellers
- We're in an age of data overload
- We can design for eye scanning
  - Turn image/face towards content to drive viewer
- 4x4 Model for Knowledge Content
- Create content on four levels
  - Water cooler - attention grabber, quick snippets, tweet, image, short video
  - The cafe - longer conversation, blog post, short article, medium length video
  - The research library - dig deeper, research, long articles
  - The lab - play with data and tools, interaction
- Get the right people to the right content by starting at the top level and drill down
- Components on four levels
  - Visualization
  - Storytelling
  - Interactivity
  - Shareability
- Know your audience and adjust presentation to them
  - Culture - language, perspective, narrative context (does the audience know the context of what you're showing)
  - Level of expertise - are your audience members experts or not as informed? 
  - Consumption context/channel - where you're publishing will change your output (more details, more stats, more fun, etc.)
  - Accessibility - data consumption through audio instead of visual, color blindness, think about contrast and font size [Color Blindness Simulator](http://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/)
  - True believers or skeptics? - are you sharing information to change minds or to reflect the "truth"
  - Action - why are you sharing the data? What action are you looking for from your audience? Design to achieve this action
  - Imagine that you are your audience and develop your data/visualization for them
- "Whenever you're doing a visualization, ask why should I not use a bar chart?" 
- Common chart types - bar chart, line chart, timeline, scatterplot, bubble chart
- How to make a good visualization? Make visualizations 
  - That are <b>Accurate</b>
  - That tell a good <b>Story</b>
  - That provide real <b>Knowledge</b> to your audience
- Visual form allows us to parse numbers more easily than numeric/text form
- We remember and learn more from visual information
- Gestalt Principles
  - Figure/Ground - used most often in logo design (FedEx logo), least used in data visualization but the bottom part of a visualization is perceived as the figure/data  and the top part is perceived as the background
  - Proximity - items next to or near each other are percieved as grouped/similar/together
  - Similarity - similar objects are different from dissimlar objects
  - Parallelism - things in parallel are assumed to be together and similar, patterns/trend lines in visualizations
  - Common Fate - items moving or moving in the same direction are percieved as together (animated visualzations)
  - Closure and Continuity - our brain completes pictures, we see things that aren't there; culture can influence continuity
  - Key to how people percieve things visually
  - Use them to draw attention and differentiate pieces of a visualization
  - Think about these priniciples to maximize brain engagement and triggers
- Understand your data
  - Mean vs. Median - need to understand the spread and make-up of your data to know which stat to use (outliers, consistency, etc.)
  - Actual Number vs. Rank Index vs. Percentile - what will be most helpful to understanding? Numbers can be too big to understand, rank and percentile can show comparisons 
  - Change in Numbers vs. Actual Number - rate of change might be more infomrative than the actual number 
  - Know sample size and methodology - how was the data collected? What's its quality and reliability?
  - Correlation vs. Causation
  - Start with a headline
  - What's the headline for the data? Figure out how to summarize it in a few words
  - Figure out headline without the "answers" filled in because you want to look to the data for the answers and remove bias
  - Be able to spot mistakes - you need to know your data well enough to spot mistakes then you can dig in and correct
  - Make sure you don't succumb to bias when looking at your data and developing visualizations - be open to the data showing something you don't expect
- Visualization can be both explanatory and exploratory - decide how you want to design your visualization, if possible, it's best to try and do both 
  
<b>Introduction to Data</b>
- Design visualizations around Who? What? When? Where? Why? How?
  - These questions can be organized into a hierarchy based on the situation/application 
  - Then use this hierarchy to organize your data and visualization
- Also ask...
  - What's missing in/from the data? Possible solutions: acknowledge what's missing and move on, ask for missing data from the source, generate missing data 
  - What in the world can I add? "Find more data from other sources to provide context and complete the picture" 
  - What's wild? What can I do that's different? "Take a unique visual approach, bring in unexpected contextual data, create an out-of-the-box interactive experience"
- Before designing a visualization, you need to explore and know your data
- Experiment with different chart types side by side for the same variables as you explore your data
- Data almost never comes in the form you need it in, so part of the job of data visualization is cleaning and transforming the data
- Getting raw data is really important - it's the best you can get and the most granular
- Common data adjustments
  - Calculate indexes and ratios - important for making comparisons to make sure you're comparing apples to apples
  - Calculate percentiles - makes it easier to compare numbers to each other as part of a whole
  - Aggregate - makes data easier to work with and handle
  - Regroup - change groupings from the form you received it in to make it easier to manipulate (transpose, pivot, filter, etc.)
  - Convert from Excel/CSV to JSON/XML/MySQL - convert format of data file; online there are alot of tools for converting from one file to another plus many programming languages have functions that can convert
  - Always expect that you will have to adjust your data 

<b>Sketches and Wireframes</b>
- Capture your ideas in a basic form before doing design work
- Use pen/paper, tablet, whiteboard, etc. to sketch things out
- It's very fast to design a visual/dashboard by quickly sketching
- It's easy and fast to get to ideas and iterate through them while sketching it out
- Experimentations with shapes and ideas can happen quickly when sketching without having to worry about how to code it
- Don't have to worry about aligning things properly (columns, rows, etc.) when sketching
- Drawings can be bigger than is possible on the computer - you can see the whole picture
- The physicality of drawing is also beneficial - it's a more staisfying form of brainstorming 
- You don't have to be an artist - it's about brainstorming and capturing and idea

<b>Storytelling</b>
- Humans are wired for storytelling
- You can structure a narrative from your data
- You don't have to enforce a linear structure/consumption
  - But you can do this by using a "Next" button and interaction
  - Or by using sorting/filtering buttons in a specific order
- Story structure: beginning, challenge, middle, climax, denouement, grand finale
- Start by thinking of some headlines for your data/story (fun ones, serious ones, etc.)
  - "What will people tweet when they share your visualization?"
  - Can have blanks in headline since the data is going to tell you the answer and you want to remove bias risk
- Set up introduction/background
- Challenge can be added by using a call-out in your visualization (call-out)
- Middle is the main portion of your visualization
- Climax of your story can be highlighted as a focal point/call-out
- Don't always get a chance to do a denouement or conclusion - user might leave
- Conclusion can be put in the lower right hand corner with data sources in a static graphic
- In an interactive graphic, a conclusion could be put at the end - the last visual/page that comes up as they click through
- Think of all visualizations/projects as a story line
- You have to connect with audience and speak their language
- Data can be confusing and unrelatable to many people
- Take numbers and turn them into something people can relate to - what does a number mean?
- Make number tangible through metaphors (x number of football fields, enough to carpet x houses, etc.)
- But need a metaphor that people can visualize and something that's on topic/relevant
  - Want something people can see/relate to and is on the same topic as the data/visualization
- "Assume your audience knows less than use and provide extra context" so it's understandable 

<b>Visual Display</b>
- Communicating visually...
  - Makes data tangible
  - Simplifies (reduces text, conveys meaning quickly)
  - Sets context 
- Icons can grab attention, but be careful because some things can detract
  - Example - theme based imagery in a bar chart - using irregular shapes makes it hard to compare pieces of data
- Background images can draw the eye through the visualization (Left to Right, Top to Bottom, etc.)
- Types in Data Visualization
  - Axes and Legends - always label axes and include legends but don't call too much attention to them (smaller text)
  - Labels - balance between accuracy, readability, and ascetics
  - Callouts - use to indicate a benchmark or important point, draw the eye (use different font face/weight/color/background)
  - Infographics - important to think about overall typography
- Position, size, color, contrast (opacity), and shape are the five ways to show differentiation
- It's important to consider scale when creating charts and visualizations
  - Does the chart type require a certain approach to scaling?
    - Example - bar charts should start at 0 since the height means something and reflects the data
  - Are there internal references?
    - Does the data need to have a reference? 
    - Example - a line chart doesn't necessarily need the whole scale (0 to 10,000) to show change over time, just make sure that all of the data is shown (zoom in to applicable numbers)
  - Are there external references?
    - A number outside of the context of the data
    - Set the scale based on an external target/reference
  - Is the scale fair and unbiased?
  - Look at your chart with different scales, are you being accurate? Why are you choosing that scale?
  - Channel your audience - make sure scale will help them understand (think about both skeptics and believers)
- Come to data visualization with an open mind, with no pre-conceptions - try to think about your visualization from a beginner perspective, someone who doesn't know anything about what you're trying to show
- For complex/interactive visualizations you can create a how-to guide with screenshots, labels, and explanations
- Include notes on sources and technology used to create visualization
- Basic charts and when to use them
  -  Bar chart - humans can easily parse the data in bars; always start with a bar chart, but hard to show lots of groups of bars
  - Line chart - better for showing changes in values over time; use for data over time
  - Area chart - filled in line chart, but hard to see relative values when there's overlap
  - Stacked area chart - good for showing categories over time in reference to each other
  - Scatter plot - good for two variables and for showing correlation
  - Bubble chart - add third variable to a scatter plot
  - Pie chart - "hard to parse when there are more than a couple data points" and "really bad at showing slight variance between data points" but it is good at comparing two data points
- Alternative charts and when to use them
  - Box plots - good for showing multiple variables/data points (example -  stock price at the beginning of the day and end of the day, average price during the day, and high and low price for the day)
  - Heatmap - good for seeing trends, correlations, overlaps across a number of variables
  - Radar charts - good at showing multiple variables and relative strength between items, but the eye has a hard time parsing data
  - Parallel coordinates - good for comparison and multiple variables; easy to see trends and relationships between variables, but it can be overwhelming when there's a lot of data
  - Scatterplot matrix - multipler variables in comparison with one another; easy to see correlations and patterns
- Hierarchical Data
  - Tree diagram - default form for hierarchical data, easy and understandable
  - Node link diagram - similar to tree diagram except much larger and includes more detail and links
  - Force directed layout - graphic settles in an orientation that eliminates edges crossing over
  - Adjacency matrix - allows you to see high level and details (correlations); sorting affects how you see the data and patterns, so it's important to think about how you sort
  - Tree map - mostly about hierarchy rather than connections between items
  - Cord diagram - cicular display with variables on the outside and connections in the middle; attractive because we like curved lines but can be hard to parse (like pie charts); difficult because there can be a huge amount of data
  - Venn diagram - good at showing big picture but not specifics
- Maps
  - Google maps can be used by developers with Javascript API
  - Five standard ways to show data on maps
    - Markers - highlight points of interest 
    - Layers - show data associated with a region on top of the map (i.e. dots)
    - Chloropleth - show data by coloring shape of countries, counties, etc. 
    - Heat map - show concentration of data by coloring regions
    - Flows - show movement between regions (often done using arrows or lines between regions or countries)
- Creative and Innovative Forms
  - Be thoughtful about how and when you use innovative/creative forms of visualization; make sure you're not distorting the data

<b>Interactivitiy</b>
- Animation can bring data to life and add understanding and interest
- Four key arguments for using motion in data visualization
   - Transitions - motion can make smooth and interesting transitions between views of your data and, more importantly, animated transitions can help the user track individual points 
   - Interaction feedback - show the user that there's something behind the point/bar/etc. that they're hovering over so they know to click on it and get more information
   - Draw the eye - use motion to draw the user's attention to a certain area
   - Change over time - use motion to show data moving over time (Example: [Gap Minder](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2013$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj2tPLxKvvnNPA;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID0;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=194;dataMax=96846$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=23;dataMax=86$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=;example=75))
- "Eye candy" can create better user interaction with your visualization 
- If you have the time/budget/resources you should try to go interactive
- Interactivity = Tangibility which can enhance learning and makes the data/message more memorable
- Visualizations that are relatable will keep the user's interest - interactivity can be used to make a visualization relatable (buttons/options that a user can click on to see/filter their industry/demographic/etc.)
   - "Make your data story into their data story" 
- Interaction can also increase credibility since the user can dig in and really understand the data and methodology
   - With interactivity you can get past the constraints of your own limited time to process the data, limited space to show the data, etc. and allow the user to explore on their own
- Don't start by thinking about interaction and buttons, etc. - start by thinking about your data, the story you're going to tell, and your audience
- Think about What's not easy to see in the data? What's missing? What can you add? What might your user want to know?
   - Interactivity can show what's hidden in your data - add rollover callouts, filters, comparisons, etc.
- Don't add filters and buttons to show every single tiny piece of data (don't try to replicate Excel or the data sheet)
- Interactivity can show things you might not have thought of, but make sure you develop the tools for interactivity after you've developed the baseline of what you want to show
- Audience and goals of what you want to show should drive your visualization and interactivity
- When trying to pick a technology to implement your visualization think about...
   - Is the platform something that will be "one-off/short-term/static" or "reusable/permanent/evolving"?
   - Is your audience "technophobic/old-fashioned/under-gadegtized" or "techno-driven/modern/gadget-laden"?
   - Need to think about audience's device compatibility (version of IE, mobile OS, etc.)
   - Is the visual you're creating "simple/standard" or "complex/custom"?
   - Do you have the technical capabilities to develop what you want to build or will you need help?
   - Who will be maintaining the support for the visualization you or someone else? If it's someone else make sure the visualization is implemented in something easy to learn and widely used
   - Are there technical requirements for the end customer/user? Do they use only Microsoft, only open source? Do they use certain browsers or configurations? All of these requirements will affect the technology you choose
- Tableau, Qlik, Gephi, Highcharts, ZingCharts are all tools that are easy to use right away without much development skill
- D3 is becoming a standard for developing custom visualizations
- Raphael is another JavaScript library for custom visualizations
- For great examples of visualization check out New York Times Graphics, Wired Magazine, Fast Company, Bloomberg, The Guardian, FiveThirtyEight
